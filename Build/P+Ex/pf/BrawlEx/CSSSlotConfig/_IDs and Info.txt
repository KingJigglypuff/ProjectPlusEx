The last true costume values should be no later than 0x62-0x63!

WARNING!! Do not place any Wario costume ID at 0xF (15), 0x1F (31), 0x2F (47) or 0x3F (63). These break the game if you try to load Wario-Man
from the CSS. There are enough IDs to still give him 50, so simply select a different value instead of using those specific four.
Mr. Game & Watch has two known unusable costume slots: 0xB (12) and 0xC (13). These are designated by red colors inside his costume .pac file.
